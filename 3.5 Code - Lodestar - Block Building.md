## Receive Gossip Topic `beacon_block` or `beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar`

Code: [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/network/gossip/handlers/index.ts]] L:167

```TypeScript
export function getGossipHandlers (modules: ValidatorFnsModules, options: GossipHandlerOpts): GossipHandlers {
  const {chain, config, metrics, network, logger} = modules;
  return {
    [GossipType.beacon_block]: async (signedBlock, topic, peerIdStr, seenTimestampSec) => {
      // ...
      /* explained in 'Process The Block' below */
      handleValidBeaconBlock()
    },
    [GossipType.beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar]: async (blockAndBlocks, topic, peerIdStr, seenTimestampSec) => {
      /* will be activated since deneb upgrade */
      /* explained in 'Process The Block' below */
      handleValidBeaconBlock()
    }
  }
}
```

The topic has upgraded from `beacon_block` to `beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar` with the [[Deneb]] upgrade. As the name indicates, the new topic would expect also 'blobs_sidecar' in the payload. 'blobs_sidecar' means some extra arbitrary data that get included in the beacon chain but **not** sent to the execution engine. Since it saves the computation of execution engine, it is saves gas cost for Layer-2's, which only want to store 'rolled up' data to Layer-1 Ethereum.

It's also important to note that if the block is verified, the consensus client will eventually send JSON-RPC call `engine_newPayload`.

> [!NOTE]- Spec References
> The block and sidecar is introduced in [deneb](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/deneb/validator.md#block-and-sidecar-proposal) to include [EIP-4844](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4844#consensus-layer-validation).

### Process The Block
If the payload is verified, it goes on to be included in the beacon chain. Below is simplified code based on [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/blocks/index.ts]]:

```TypeScript
  function handleValidBeaconBlock(blockInput: BlockInput, peerIdStr: string, seenTimestampSec: number): void {
    chain
      .processBlock(blockInput, {
        // ...
      })
      .then(() => {
        // ...
        /* metrics logging */
      })
      .catch((e) => {
        // ...
      });
  }
```

Where `chain` is `BeaconChain` instance, refer to [[3.1 Code - Lodestar - CLI Beacon Node#Create `chain`]].

```TypeScript
async processBlock(block: BlockInput, opts?: ImportBlockOpts): Promise<void> {
  /* 
  blockProcessor queues the jobs 
  and exposes function processBlocksJob,
  which calls async function processBlocks.
  */
  return await this.blockProcessor.processBlocksJob([block], opts);
}
```

The queue is configured with `QUEUE_MAX_LENGTH = 256`. If the node is too much out of sync, it will throw an error. Otherwise if it does not exceed `maxConcurrency`, it will run the job.

More about `processBlock`:
```TypeScript
export async function processBlocks(
  this: BeaconChain,
  blocks: BlockInput[],
  opts: BlockProcessOpts & ImportBlockOpts
): Promise<void> {
  if (blocks.length === 0) {
    return; // TODO: or throw?
  } else if (blocks.length > 1) {
    /* Here chainSegment just means multiple blocks */
    assertLinearChainSegment(this.config, blocks);
  }

  try {
    /* 
    I think verifyBlocksSanityChecks is a bad name here.
    Its better called 'sanitizeBlocks'.
    It does 'some early cheap sanity checks on the block'
    and returns filtered objects.
    */
    const {relevantBlocks, parentSlots, parentBlock} = verifyBlocksSanityChecks(this, blocks, opts);

    // No relevant blocks, skip verifyBlocksInEpoch()
    if (relevantBlocks.length === 0 || parentBlock === null) {
      // parentBlock can only be null if relevantBlocks are empty
      return;
    }

	/* 
	This is the core logic which interacts with the execution engine,
	therefore it is able to get:
	- postStates, BeaconState after the block
	- proposerBalanceDeltas, the execution result of transactions
	- segmentExecStatus

	*/
    // Fully verify a block to be imported immediately after. Does not produce any side-effects besides adding intermediate
    // states in the state cache through regen.
    const {postStates, proposerBalanceDeltas, segmentExecStatus} = await verifyBlocksInEpoch.call(
      this,
      parentBlock,
      relevantBlocks,
      opts
    );

	/*

    // If segmentExecStatus has lvhForkchoice then, the entire segment should be invalid

    );

### `verifyBlocksInEpoch`

The main logic in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/blocks/verifyBlock.ts]]:
```TypeScript
const [segmentExecStatus, {postStates, proposerBalanceDeltas}] = await Promise.all([
  // Execution payloads
  verifyBlocksExecutionPayload(this, parentBlock, blocks, preState0, abortController.signal, opts),
  // Run state transition only
  // TODO: Ensure it yields to allow flushing to workers and engine API
  verifyBlocksStateTransitionOnly(preState0, blocksInput, this.logger, this.metrics, abortController.signal, opts),

  // All signatures at once
  verifyBlocksSignatures(this.bls, this.logger, this.metrics, preState0, blocks, opts),
]);
```

#### `verifyBlockExecutionPayload`
[[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/blocks/verifyBlocksExecutionPayloads.ts]] 
`verifyBlockExecutionPayload` communicates to execution client:
```TypeScript
const execResult = await chain.executionEngine.notifyNewPayload(
  chain.config.getForkName(block.message.slot),
  executionPayloadEnabled
);
```
It maps to engines API endpoint `engine_newPayloadV3`, `engine_newPayloadV2` or `engine_newPayloadV1`, depending on which upgrade it is.

#### `verifyBlocksStateTransitionOnly`
[[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/blocks/verifyBlocksStateTransitionOnly.ts]]
`verifyBlocksStateTransitionOnly` runs the state transition and gets to know whether the block is valid. It calls `stateTransition` under the hood.

#### `verifyBlocksSignatures`
[[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/blocks/verifyBlocksSignatures.ts]]

## `importBlock`
[[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/blocks/importBlock.ts]]

Blobs sidecar is handled differently if it is present (after deneb upgrade):
```TypeScript
if (blockInput.type === BlockInputType.postDeneb) {
	const {blobs} = blockInput;
	// NOTE: Old blobs are pruned on archive
	await this.db.blobsSidecar.add(blobs);
	this.logger.debug("Persisted blobsSidecar to hot DB", {
	  blobsLen: blobs.blobs.length,
	  slot: blobs.beaconBlockSlot,
	  root: toHexString(blobs.beaconBlockRoot),
	});
}
```

The code itself is very clearly commented. I copied the comments in `function importBlock`(L:47) here for easier reading and added some notes:
1. Persist block to hot DB (pre-emptively)
2. Import block to fork-choice.
   > Could also refer to pseudo code [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/fork-choice.md#on_block).
3. Import attestations to fork-choice
4. Import attester slashings to fork-choice
5. Compute head. If new head, immediately stateCache.setHeadState().
   > It happens after step 3. since Ethereum consensus protocol says 'the branch with the most attestation wins'.
   > `this.stateCache.setHeadState(headState) // 'this' is chain`
1. Queue notifyForkchoiceUpdate to engine api. 
   > Notify the execution engine that this block is 'finalized' so that the execution engine can cleanup the non-relevant fork choices.
2. Add post state to stateCache

## Send Gossip Topic `beacon_block` or `beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar`

In [[repositories/lodestar/packages/validator/src/services/blockDuties.ts]]:
```TypeScript
clock.runEverySlot(this.runBlockDutiesTask);
```
where it calls `pollBeaconProposersAndNotify` to retrieve the beacon proposers and ask them to produce a block. Strictly speaking there will be only one beacon proposer per slot, but since locally we may have multiple heads in fork choice, we may end up with multiple proposers. Hopefully the other nodes are honest, then they will not propagate the message if they know this validator not on duty.

`api.validator.getProposerDuties` will calculate whether any of the local validators are the next proposer.

If any validator is on duty, it will call [`createAndPublishBlock`](repositories/lodestar/packages/validator/src/services/block.ts). It eventually calls `executionEngine.getPayload`(endpoint `engine_getPayloadV1`, `engine_getPayloadV2` or `engine_getPayloadV3`) to send JSON-RPC request to execution client to produce the block.

If MEV is available, then the consensus client will produce 'blinded block'(`produceBlindedBlock`), which is a block produced without execution client but _will_ get signed 'blindly'. This also links to [PBS](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/pbs/) for 'proposer-builder separation', which is still in research phase. But clients like lodestar seem to already start implementation. The different handling is in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/api/impl/beacon/blocks/index.ts]]:
```TypeScript
async publishBlindedBlock(signedBlindedBlock) {
  const executionBuilder = chain.executionBuilder;
  if (!executionBuilder) throw Error("exeutionBuilder required to publish SignedBlindedBeaconBlock");
  let signedBlock: allForks.SignedBeaconBlock;

  /*
  ask executionBuilder to create blinded block instead of
  ask executionEngine to produce block
  */
  signedBlock = await executionBuilder.submitBlindedBlock(signedBlindedBlock);

  /* The function below is directly called in case of a non-blinded block */
  return await this.publishBlock(signedBlock);
},

async publishBlock(signedBlock) {
  const seenTimestampSec = Date.now() / 1000;

  // Simple implementation of a pending block queue. Keeping the block here recycles the API logic, and keeps the
  // REST request promise without any extra infrastructure.
  const msToBlockSlot = computeTimeAtSlot(config, signedBlock.message.slot, chain.genesisTime) * 1000 - Date.now();
  if (msToBlockSlot <= MAX_API_CLOCK_DISPARITY_MS && msToBlockSlot > 0) {
	// If block is a bit early, hold it in a promise. Equivalent to a pending queue.
	await sleep(msToBlockSlot);
  }

  // TODO Deneb: Open question if broadcast to both block topic + block_and_blobs topic
  const blockForImport =
	config.getForkSeq(signedBlock.message.slot) >= ForkSeq.deneb
	  ? getBlockInput.postDeneb(
		  config,
		  signedBlock,
		  chain.getBlobsSidecar(signedBlock.message as deneb.BeaconBlock)
		)
	  : getBlockInput.preDeneb(config, signedBlock);

  await promiseAllMaybeAsync([
    /* sends gossip topic beacon_block or beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar */
	// Send the block, regardless of whether or not it is valid. The API
	// specification is very clear that this is the desired behaviour.
	() => network.publishBeaconBlockMaybeBlobs(blockForImport),

    /* immediately import the locally proposed block */
	() =>
	  chain.processBlock(blockForImport).catch((e) => {
		if (e instanceof BlockError && e.type.code === BlockErrorCode.PARENT_UNKNOWN) {
		  network.events.emit(NetworkEvent.unknownBlockParent, blockForImport, network.peerId.toString());
		}
		throw e;
	  }),
  ]);
},
```
