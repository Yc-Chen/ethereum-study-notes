From lodestar documentation:

- CLI `lodestar validator`: https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/reference/cli/#validator

It's codebase start with [`packages/validator`](repositories/lodestar/packages/validator/README.md) folder.

## From CLI:

[[repositories/lodestar/packages/cli/src/cmds/validator/index.ts]]

```TypeScript
export const validator: ICliCommand<IValidatorCliArgs, IGlobalArgs> = {
  command: "validator",
  // ...
  handler: validatorHandler,
};
```

`validatorHandler` is the main function. Similar to `beacon-node` initialization, it also parses configs, prepares databases, and prepares metrics. The core is about initializing `Validator` class in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/validator/src/validator.ts]]:

```TypeScript
const validator = await Validator.initializeFromBeaconNode(
    // ...
  );
```

## Deep Dive into `Validator.constructor`

After having the genesis block, static function `initializeFromBeaconNode` creates `Validator` instance.

### Create `IndicesService` and `ValidatorStore`
```TypeScript
const indicesService = new IndicesService(logger, api, metrics);
```
Every validator has a unique index: https://beaconscan.com/validators. (First column 'INDEX'). `IndicesService` and `ValidatorStore` together make sure it keeps a local storage of known validators by their public key and validator index.

`ValidatorStore` can store multiple signers, i.e. one node can have multiple validators. It also implements functions like `signAttestation` and `signBlock`. Later we will dive into the steps in [[3.4 Code - Lodestar - Attestation]]

### `BlockProposingService`, `AttestationService` and `SyncCommitteeService`
```TypeScript
this.blockProposingService = new BlockProposingService(
  // ...
);
this.attestationService = new AttestationService(
  // ...
);
this.syncCommitteeService = new SyncCommitteeService(
  // ...
);
```

All these services implement periodic tasks that runs every slot for jobs of block proposing, attestations, or sync committee. Sync committee, specifically, is introduced in 'altair' upgrade to help light client: https://github.com/ethereum/annotated-spec/blob/master/altair/sync-protocol.md. Attestation and block proposing also have implemented 'xxxDutiesService' that runs every epoch to check for their duties.


> [!NOTE] Duties at start of every epoch
> https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/blob/master/validator-flow.md
> "On start of every epoch, validator should fetch proposer duties. Result is array of objects, each containing proposer pubkey and slot at which he is suppose to propose."
> "On start of every epoch, validator should ask for attester duties for epoch + 1. Result are array of objects with validator, his committee and attestation slot."
