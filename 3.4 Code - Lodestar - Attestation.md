```TypeScript
export function getGossipHandlers (modules: ValidatorFnsModules, options: GossipHandlerOpts): GossipHandlers {
  const {chain, config, metrics, network, logger} = modules;
  return {
    [GossipType.beacon_attestation]: async (attestation, {subnet}, _peer, seenTimestampSec) => {
      let validationResult: {indexedAttestation: phase0.IndexedAttestation; subnet: number};
      try {
        /* calls validateGossipAttestation. will go into details later. */
        validationResult = await validateGossipAttestationRetryUnknownRoot(chain, attestation, subnet);
      } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof AttestationError && e.action === GossipAction.REJECT) {
          chain.persistInvalidSszValue(ssz.phase0.Attestation, attestation, "gossip_reject");
        }
        throw e;
      }

      // Handler
      const {indexedAttestation} = validationResult;
      metrics?.registerGossipUnaggregatedAttestation(seenTimestampSec, indexedAttestation);

      // Node may be subscribe to extra subnets (long-lived random subnets). For those, validate the messages
      // but don't import them, to save CPU and RAM
      if (!network.attnetsService.shouldProcess(subnet, attestation.data.slot)) {
        return;
      }

      try {
        /* add to attestationPool, which later produces aggregated attestation */
        const insertOutcome = chain.attestationPool.add(attestation);

          logger.debug("Error adding gossip unaggregated attestation to forkchoice", {subnet}, e as Error);

## Send Gossip Topic `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}`
[`produceAttestation`](repositories/lodestar/packages/validator/src/services/attestation.ts) is called every slot by `AttestationService` if the validator is 'on duty' to be an attester of the committee. 

```TypeScript
const attestationNoCommittee = await this.produceAttestation(duties[0].duty.committeeIndex, slot);
```
It further calls [`api.validator.produceAttestationData()`](repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/api/impl/validator/index.ts), which depends on the data from the `chain.forkChoice`  and  `chain.getHeadState`. (refer to [[3.5 Code - Lodestar - Block Building#`importBlock`]])

```TypeScript
await this.signAndPublishAttestations(slot, attestationNoCommittee, duties);
```
It calls `api.beacon.submitPoolAttestations(signedAttestations)` to send gossip topic `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}`

Note that it happens latest in 1/3 of the slot or as soon as the local beacon chain head changes:
```TypeScript
await Promise.race([sleep(this.clock.msToSlot(slot + 1 / 3), signal), this.emitter.waitForBlockSlot(slot)]);
```


## Send Gossip Topic `beacon_aggregate_and_proof`

[`produceAndPublishAggregates`](repositories/lodestar/packages/validator/src/services/attestation.ts) is called every slot by `AttestationService` if the validator is 'on duty' to be an aggregator. 
It produces aggregated attestation and signing them, and eventually calls the [`api.validator.publishAggregateAndProofs`](repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/api/impl/validator/index.ts). It then sends to the global gossip topic `GossipType.beacon_aggregate_and_proof`.

In [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/chain/opPools/attestationPool.ts]] function `aggregateAttestationInto`:
```TypeScript
  aggregate.aggregationBits.set(bitIndex, true);
  aggregate.signature = bls.Signature.aggregate([
    aggregate.signature,
    signatureFromBytesNoCheck(attestation.signature),
  ]);
```
It aggregates single attestations and their signatures using the BLS curve. For a great explanation of attestation and BLS curve, refer to [BLS Signatures from eth2book](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/signatures/#bls-signatures)

## Attestation Committee and Aggregator Selection

(The same principle actually also applies to other committees, like sync committee.)

It is calculated per epoch by a calculation based on the locally known validators and their BLS signature. The selection of aggregator is based on RANDAO and BLS signature. For detailed explanation, refer to: 
- https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/shuffling/#shuffling for assigning attestation committees.
- https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/building_blocks/aggregator/ for selecting aggregators.

Some highlights:
- lodestar checks for each local validator which committee they belong in `api.validator.getAttesterDuties`. The algorithm (shuffling) is a pseudo-random function [`getCommitteeAssignments(epoch, requestedValidatorIndices)`](packages/state-transition/src/cache/epochContext.ts)
- For each local validator, lodestar is able to check whether it is an aggregator by pseudo-random function [`isAggregatorFromCommitteeLength(committee.length, slotSignature)`](repositories/lodestar/packages/state-transition/src/util/aggregator.ts)
