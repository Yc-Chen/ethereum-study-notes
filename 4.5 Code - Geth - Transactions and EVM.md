A transaction roughly includes (I'm not trying to be accurate here, for correct schema see [spec](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation/))
- sender
- receiver
- value
- input

When a block gets included or built, the execution engine runs the transactions and update the state. When the receiver is empty, it is likely a smart contract creation request; and the 'input' is expected to be the contract code.  The 'receiver' can be either a wallet address or a contract address. If it is a contract address, the code that is deployed to the address will be executed.

## Smart Contract
Smart contract is some logic that gets executed on chain on Ethereum. Compared to other language or compute environment, smart contract has some 'irreversible' constraint, e.g. once you send the token, you cannot get it back. Also it does not have the notion of 'time' as it only relies on the clock of Ethereum, namely slot and epoch. If you have not tried writing any Solidity before, I highly recommend to follow the [CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/) tutorial. It gives a sense of what smart contract is. 

Smart contracts written in Solidity will get compiled to bytecode that represents 'Opcode', such as `ADD`, `SUB`. This [video with timestamp](https://youtu.be/_tcyI_lNvo0?t=364) is also a great source in explaining how EVM Opcodes work. For this note, I will focus on how smart contracts get on to Ethereum and get executed in EVM.

### Smart Contract Deployment
After writing smart contract and testing locally, the final step is to deploy it to testnet or mainnet. Deploying smart contract is essentially making JSON-RPC calls as this example ['Deploying a contract using JSON_RPC'](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/#deploying-contract). The most important step is:
```sh
curl --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method": "eth_sendTransaction", "params": [{"from": "0x9b1d35635cc34752ca54713bb99d38614f63c955", "gas": "0x1c31e", "data": "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"}], "id": 6}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8545
{"id":6,"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0xe1f3095770633ab2b18081658bad475439f6a08c902d0915903bafff06e6febf"}
```
where
- `eth_sendTransaction` is one of the JSON-RPC methods, also refer to [[4.2 Code - Geth - JSON-RPC]]
- `result` is the compiled contract bytes.
- `to` is left out because this is a contract deployment request, not to send a token to a different account. In [[repositories/go-ethereum/core/state_processor.go]] L:132
  ```go
  if msg.To() == nil {
  	  receipt.ContractAddress = crypto.CreateAddress(evm.TxContext.Origin, tx.Nonce())
  }
  ```

### A Smart Contract Deployment Example on Etherscan
Take the famous Uniswap as an example, this is the address of Uniswap Router on Ethereum:
```
0x3fC91A3afd70395Cd496C647d5a6CC9D4B2b7FAD
```
1. By copying it to Etherscan, you get to see its overview: https://etherscan.io/address/0x3fc91a3afd70395cd496c647d5a6cc9d4b2b7fad
2. Click on the 'Contract' tab, scroll to the bottom and look for 'Contract Creation Code'. This is the `result` field when making the `eth_sendTransaction` call to deploy the contract.
	- Click 'Decompile Bytecode' and it will show the solidity code similar to its source code.
	- Click 'Switch to Opcodes View', it will show
	  ```
	  PUSH1 0xa0
	  PUSH1 0x40
	  ...
      ```
1. Scroll back to the top and click 'txn' in the 'More Info' box, as shown in ![[Uniswap-Etherscan.png]]
   **This is the deployment transaction of the contract.**
4. Click to expand 'More Details' and look for 'Input Data'. **It is the same as the 'Contract Creation Code' in step 2**.

## Transfer or Contract Execution in EVM
Continuing the [[4.4 Code - Geth - Block Building#Block Execution]]
1. [[repositories/go-ethereum/core/state_processor.go]], `applyTransaction` -> `ApplyMessage(evm, msg, gp)`
2. [[repositories/go-ethereum/core/state_transition.go]], `ApplyMessage` -> `TransitionDb`:
   ```go
   if contractCreation {
		ret, _, st.gas, vmerr = st.evm.Create(sender, st.data, st.gas, st.value)
   } else {
		// Increment the nonce for the next transaction
		st.state.SetNonce(msg.From(), st.state.GetNonce(sender.Address())+1)
		ret, st.gas, vmerr = st.evm.Call(sender, st.to(), st.data, st.gas, st.value)
   }
   ```
3. [[repositories/go-ethereum/core/vm/runtime/runtime.go]], `Create` or `Call`
4. [[repositories/go-ethereum/core/vm/evm.go]], `func (evm *EVM) create` or `func (evm *EVM) Call`
   Be it a wallet address or contract address, always transfer the value:
   ```go
   evm.Context.Transfer(evm.StateDB, caller.Address(), address, value)
   ```
   But if the account is a wallet address, then it has no code, so the contract execution will be skipped:
   ```go
   code := evm.StateDB.GetCode(addr)
   /* if the address is a wallet address */
   if len(code) == 0 {
 	   ret, err = nil, nil // gas is unchanged
   } else {
       // ...
       /* otherwise run the smart contract */
       ret, err = evm.interpreter.Run(contract, input, false)
       // ...
   }
   ```
5. [[repositories/go-ethereum/core/vm/interpreter.go]], where the main logic is:
   ```go
   op = contract.GetOp(pc)
   operation := in.table[op]
   res, err = operation.execute(&pc, in, callContext)
   ```

### Gas Estimation
The JSON-RPC method `eth_estimateGas` allows users to estimate the gas cost given the transaction. Obviously, the more computation the higher gas cost. The calculation is done by calling `ApplyMessage` to one node. It should be very accurate and already consumes computing power, then why is it called 'estimate'? My take is that:
- The one specific node might not be up-to-date with the latest gas cost
- Consuming computing power of one node isn't that bad; a real transaction will be broadcasted and executed in all nodes.
