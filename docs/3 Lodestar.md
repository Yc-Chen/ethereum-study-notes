Below are some technical pieces that are linked to consensus clients:

* The [[gossipsub]]
* [[SSZ]]

To run lodestar, you need to call at least 2 CLIs:

* `lodestar beacon`
* `lodestar validator import`

And they will be explained later.

See more on their documentation [here](https://chainsafe.github.io/lodestar/)
