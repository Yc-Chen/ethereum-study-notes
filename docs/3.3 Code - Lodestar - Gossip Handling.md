## Gossipsub

'sub' means pubsub protocol and '[[gossipsub]]' means a pubsub protocol built on gossip protocol. Its code is [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/network/gossip/gossipsub.ts]] and it was initialized by:

```TypeScript
this.gossip = new Eth2Gossipsub(opts, {
      config,
      libp2p,
      logger,
      metrics,
      signal,
      gossipHandlers: gossipHandlers ?? getGossipHandlers({chain, config, logger, network: this, metrics}, opts),
      eth2Context: {
        activeValidatorCount: chain.getHeadState().epochCtx.currentShuffling.activeIndices.length,
        currentSlot: this.clock.currentSlot,
        currentEpoch: this.clock.currentEpoch,
      },
      peersData: this.peersData,
    });
```

Its core logic is in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/network/gossip/handlers/index.ts]] - function `getGossipHandlers`, where it defines the logic for each message, such as `GossipType.beacon_block` or `GossipType.beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar`. A lot of the topics are defined [here](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md#global-topics) in 'phase0'. Some newer ones are defined in later upgrades.

## Attestation Subnets(attnets) and Sync Subnets(syncnets)

Attestations are aggregated in subnets before broadcasted globally. The gossip topic `beacon_attestation_{subnet_id}` segregates clients into different subnets. Code is in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/network/subnets/attnetsService.ts]]

The 'sync subnets' is in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/network/subnets/syncnetsService.ts]] and it looks like simplified `attnetsService.ts`.

The subnets subscription is called in [[repositories/lodestar/packages/beacon-node/src/network/network.ts]] (the code below is simplified to focus on attnetsService) at the start of each epoch and during each network upgrades, e.g. altair, [[deneb]], etc. It does some polyfills when Ethereum decides to change topic name, e.g. from `beacon_block` to `beacon_block_and_blobs_sidecar`.

```TypeScript
private onEpoch = (epoch: Epoch): void => {
    try {
      const activeForks = getActiveForks(this.config, epoch);
      for (let i = 0; i < activeForks.length; i++) {
        if (activeForks[i + 1]) {
          const prevFork = activeForks[i];
          const nextFork = activeForks[i + 1];
          const forkEpoch = this.config.forks[nextFork].epoch;

          // Before fork transition
          if (epoch === forkEpoch - FORK_EPOCH_LOOKAHEAD) {
            this.attnetsService.subscribeSubnetsToNextFork(nextFork);
            this.syncnetsService.subscribeSubnetsToNextFork(nextFork);
          }

          // After fork transition
          if (epoch === forkEpoch + FORK_EPOCH_LOOKAHEAD) {
            this.attnetsService.unsubscribeSubnetsFromPrevFork(prevFork);
            this.syncnetsService.unsubscribeSubnetsFromPrevFork(prevFork);
          }
        }
      }
    } catch (e) {
      this.logger.error("Error on BeaconGossipHandler.onEpoch", {epoch}, e as Error);
    }
  };
```

`attnetsService` has 2 periodic functions itself: `onSlot` and `onEpoch`. `onSlot` cleans up unused subnets. `onEpoch` cleans up offline validators. The difference in known has an influence in the next subnet subscription (in function `rebalanceRandomSubnets`). See more in specs:
