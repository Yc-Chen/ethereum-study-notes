Geth is previously the Ethereum client, and since merge the execution client. Looking at geth code, I can see that Ethereum is upgrading its technology stack:
* from devp2p to gossip network
* from bootnodes to discv5
* from RLP to [[SSZ]]

Below are some important namings within geth:

* [[catalyst]]
* [[clique]]
* [[Ethash]]
