## The Protocol 'eth'
While the token on Ethereum has the code ETH, the protocol that the execution client uses to sync transactions is also called 'ETH', with its full name being 'Ethereum Wire Protocol' according to the devp2p specs [here](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/eth.md#transaction-exchange). I will focus on its 'transaction exchange'.

### Receiving A Transaction from A Wallet through JSON-RPC
When a call arrives at `eth_sendTransaction` endpoint, its handled by `func SendTransaction` in [[repositories/go-ethereum/internal/ethapi/api.go]] L:1722
```go
// SendTransaction creates a transaction for the given argument, sign it and submit it to the
// transaction pool.
func (s *TransactionAPI) SendTransaction(ctx context.Context, args TransactionArgs) (common.Hash, error) {
	//...
	return SubmitTransaction(ctx, s.b, signed)
}

// ...

// SubmitTransaction is a helper function that submits tx to txPool and logs a message.
func SubmitTransaction(ctx context.Context, b Backend, tx *types.Transaction) (common.Hash, error) {
	// ...
	if err := b.SendTx(ctx, tx); err != nil {
		return common.Hash{}, err
	}
	// ...
	return tx.Hash(), nil
}
```

`SendTx` adds the transaction to the local transaction pool. The transaction pool `txPool` will communicate the new transaction to the other peers. In [[repositories/go-ethereum/eth/api_backend.go]] L:261
```go
func (b *EthAPIBackend) SendTx(ctx context.Context, signedTx *types.Transaction) error {
	return b.eth.txPool.AddLocal(signedTx)
}
```

### Receiving A Transaction from A Peer
In [[repositories/go-ethereum/eth/protocols/eth/handlers.go]]:
```go
func handleNewPooledTransactionHashes68(backend Backend, msg Decoder, peer *Peer) error {
    // ...
    ann := new(NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket68)
    // ...
    // Schedule all the unknown hashes for retrieval
	for _, hash := range ann.Hashes {
		peer.markTransaction(hash)
	}
	return backend.Handle(peer, ann)
}
```

Where `func Handle` in [[repositories/go-ethereum/eth/handler_eth.go]]:
```go
func (h *ethHandler) Handle(peer *eth.Peer, packet eth.Packet) error {
    case *eth.NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket68:
		return h.txFetcher.Notify(peer.ID(), packet.Hashes)
}
```
where `txFetcher` fetches unknown transactions periodically from peers.

> [!NOTE]- eth/66, eth/68, etc
> eth/66 or eth/68 is code for devp2p upgrades. They are also mentioned in the protocol changelog [here](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/caps/eth.md#change-log). In the code, they show up as suffix of function names, e.g. `NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket68` or `NewPooledTransactionHashesPacket66`.


### Tell The Transaction to (More) Peers
The code is found in the folder 'eth/protocols/eth', which is the protocol name. It is initialized in [[repositories/go-ethereum/eth/protocols/eth/peer.go]]:
```go
func NewPeer(version uint, p *p2p.Peer, rw p2p.MsgReadWriter, txpool TxPool) *Peer {
    // ...
    go peer.announceTransactions()
    // ...
    return peer
}
```
where `peer` is representing a p2p connection to one other node. `announceTransactions` is implemented in [[repositories/go-ethereum/eth/protocols/eth/peer.go]], and eventually calls `p2p.Send()` to send `NewPooledTransactionHashes(0x08)`, as said in the spec.

As the function name 'announce' suggest, this message does not send the real transaction. If the node thinks it's probably a new transaction, it will first announce it; if the peer does not have the transaction, the peer will ask for it; only then the node will send the transaction.

## About Block Communication
The spec also includes block communication, which is now taken over by the consensus client as discussed in [[3.5 Code - Lodestar - Block Building]].
